# learning-generative-deep-learning
Jupyter notebooks I have used in learning generative deep learning, they're well commented and described. Potentially very helpful for anyone learning the subject.

## Cifar10 Image Classification
This notebook gets you up to speed with the basics of deep learning, Keras and the use of convolutional neural networks; through a simple image classifier. It contains many important concepts which I've tried to describe as I code along.
